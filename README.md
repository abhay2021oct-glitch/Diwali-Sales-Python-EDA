📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The analysis focuses on:

Sales distribution across different age groups and genders

State-wise and occupation-wise sales performance

Product category analysis

Relationship between number of orders and total sales

Identification of high-value and high-volume product categories

📈 Key Insights

Sales performance is influenced more by product pricing and category mix than by order volume alone.

Some categories receive a high number of orders but generate lower revenue, indicating low ticket-size products.

Premium product categories generate higher revenue despite fewer orders.

Married women aged 26–35 years from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors, are more likely to purchase products from Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories.

💡 Business Recommendations

Focus marketing efforts on high-revenue product categories during festive sales.

Introduce bundling and upselling strategies for high-order, low-ticket products to increase average order value.

Target high-contributing customer segments with personalized festive offers.

Optimize product mix by balancing high-volume and high-value products.

🏁 Conclusion

The analysis shows that Diwali sales performance is driven more by product pricing and category mix than by order volume alone. Understanding customer segmentation and product behavior can help businesses design effective festive sales strategies and maximize revenue.
